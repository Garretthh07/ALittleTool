When I read vim.pdf, this file is just for record.

*03.8*
Normal Mode:  */# --> search for a word
              \<\> --> only match for the word               

just to remember and practice , again and again

" set the origin version of the file
Ex command: set patchmode = .orig

" copy and paste text between different file
Normal Mode:  "*yy
              "*p
